Fork and clone this repository.

For each image, create an index.html and style.css to recreate the layout. Initially, you can just create fixed width layouts for them all. If you finish all of these, as a stretch goal, try to make responsive layouts that resize and adjust as the browser width changes.

Commit each image layout separately to reinforce the staging, commiting, pushing cycle flow. After completing and commiting the first exercise, open a pull request to the original repository.
